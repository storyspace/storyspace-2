# storyspace

Week 1

This week, we fixed a small glitch with posting a story. Before, the message “Your story has been posted” would appear when the user closed out of the share your story form even if there was no story was submitted. 

We worked on the branding of Story Space by creating a simple logo. (We would love feedback on this!). Story Space was originally tied to the theme of different universes so the logo incorporates the idea of stories and space (in terms of intergalactic space - such as stars and universes) coming together. 

There is now an added option to upload an image with the story when posting a story. However, the image does not get posted with the story when it is submitted and we may need back end help to get images posted when submitted.

On the "share your story" overlay, we have added an additional method for users to exit the popup. Users are able to exit by a)submitting a story, b)clicking on the "x" button and (now) c)clicking outside of the overlay. This function uses the jQuery UI library to create a dialog box.

We also created Story Space into an organization on github so that we can now use github to properly collaborate and code this project together in a much simpler way than before.
